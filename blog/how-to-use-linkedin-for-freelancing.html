                       <p>
                            As a freelancer you are probably focused on your clients rather than keeping up 
                            with the "social media for resumes". It is true that LinkedIn was previously only used to help in the job hunt,
                            but now it is so much more than that. Unlike people looking for employment, 
                            freelancers can actually drive their entire business with just LinkedIn. 
                            <br><br>
                            LinkedIn is the most powerful platform for the B2B world. Its sole purpose is to help you 
                            connect with those that you may do business with. As a freelancer, connecting with people 
                            who need your services is crucial. Here is a guide on how to use LinkedIn to get 
                            more clients and <a href="https://fivehourfreelancer.com">grow your freelancing business</a>.
                       </p><br>
                       <h2>How to get started on LinkedIn as a Freelancer</h2>
                       <p>
                            <a href="https://www.thebalancesmb.com/introduction-to-linkedin-1794572">Getting started on LinkedIn</a> will be to first understand how the platform works. The platforms 
                            goal is to help you grow a network of people in the business world. Unlike other social 
                            platforms that help you get friends or followers, LinkedIn is all about helping you create 
                            strategic relationships. Those relationships are built by first connecting with individuals 
                            that you come in contact with through business related activities. 
                            <br><br>
                            To get started on LinkedIn, you need to first create a profile. As a freelancer you want to 
                            create your profile in a way that sells your services. When setting this up, you want to 
                            optimize the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Your Headline</li>
                                <li>Your URL</li>
                                <li>Your Summary</li>
                                <li>Your Experience</li>
                                <li>Your Endorsements</li>
                                <li>Any Past Projects, Volunteering, Etc.</li>
                            </ul>
                            After you get your profile set up, you want to ensure that it properly shows off the services you 
                            offer. Think of your LinkedIn profile as a business card. It is going to be the first thing someone 
                            sees of your brand, so make sure it makes an impact. Once your profile is properly set up, you can 
                            start building connections. 
                            <br><br>
                            <strong>Pro tip: Make sure your profile is visible when viewing other profiles. </strong>
                            You can navigate to this section by clicking on your profile “Me” icon and then clicking “Settings & Privacy”.
                       </p>
                       <img class="blog-desc-image" src="../images/linkedin-ss-1.png">
                       <p>
                            Make sure this setting is set to show Your Name and Headline when viewing someone else’s profile. This will help 
                            clients actually reach out to you first, bettering your chance of winning them as a client. 
                       </p><br>
                       <h2>Build endorsements for your skills</h2>
                       <p>
                            One of the most powerful things LinkedIn offers is endorsements. These give the opportunity for people inside of
                            your network to endorse your skills. As a freelancer this will serve as social proof for your skills to potential 
                            clients which can make a huge difference when someone is considering you for hire. 
                            <br><br>
                            Here is how you can get endorsements:
                       </p>
                       <h3>1. Ask your previous clients</h3>
                       <p>
                            The best way is to get your previous clients to endorse your skills. This is probably the best way to make your new 
                            clients confident in hiring you. 
                       </p>      
                       <h3>2. Endorse your connections</h3>
                       <p>
                            You can endorse someone by clicking on “+” inside of the “Skills & Endorsements” section of the users profile. 
                       </p>
                       <img class="blog-desc-image" style="height:300px;width:auto;" src="../images/linkedin-ss-2.png">
                       <p>
                            Endorsing some of your connections on skills they have labeled can often lead in them endorsing your skills as well. 
                       </p>
                       <h3>3. Ask your previous clients</h3>
                       <p>
                            Sending a simple message to some of your connections and asking for endorsements is one of the easiest ways to get endorsements 
                            fast. Even if you have never interacted with a connection, while they are sitting bored at work and see your message, they are 
                            likely to endorse you.
                       </p>
                       <br><br>
                       <h2>Showcase your previous work</h2>
                       <p>
                            Whether you do so in a post, or an article, showing off your previous work is the best way to advertise your services to new potential clients. 
                            <br><br>
                            Just a simple article referring to your work can lead to a new client. 
                       </p>
                       <img class="blog-desc-image"  src="../images/linkedin-ss-3.png">
                       <p>
                            Show off the work you’ve previously done to the new connections you have. This is an easy way to show off your expertise and display confidence 
                            in your portfolio. This is also another way to get more endorsements for your page. 
                       </p>
                       <h2>Build connections with potential clients</h2>
                       <p>
                        Now that your profile is set up to show off your skills, you want to start connecting with 
                        professionals that are in need of your services. Each connection is an opportunity to get a new client, 
                        so be sure to take your time finding people worth connecting with. Here are a few different ways you can 
                        go about finding connections that may turn into paying clients.
                       </p>
                       <h3>1. Search for companies in your niche</h3>
                       <p>
                            The first method is to simply search for companies in your niche and then connect with people that are employees of that company. 
                            <br><br>
                            Start by searching for the companies in your area (for this example I am selling web design services to landscaping companies).
                            <br><br>
                            First put “landscaping” into the search field. 
                       </p>
                       <img class="blog-desc-image"  src="../images/linkedin-ss-5.png">
                       <p>
                            Click on the “More” tab and choose “Companies”. 
                       </p>
                       <img class="blog-desc-image"  src="../images/linkedin-ss-4.png">
                       <p>
                       Once you get the results you can begin to look at each company profile. 
                       <br><br>
                       Navigate to the “People” section of the company profile. 
                       </p>
                       <img class="blog-desc-image"  src="../images/linkedin-ss-6.png">
                       <p>
                            Here you can search for titles of the people that would be deciding to hire you. For this example, I am looking for “Marketing Manager” or “Manager”.
                       </p>
                       <h3>2. Search for Titles of people that can hire you</h3>
                       <p>
                            This second method is similar to the first except you are searching directly for the titles of people and not going through their company page first. Depending on your freelancing service, this method may actually be ideal. 
                            <br><br>
                            For example: if you are a content writer, you can search for “Content Manager” or “Head Copywriters”.
                            
                       </p>
                       <img class="blog-desc-image"  src="../images/linkedin-ss-6.png">
                       <p>
                            You can immediately connect with these people letting them know that your services are available for hire. 
                            
                        </p>
                        <h2>Use LinkedIn Publisher to establish your authority</h2>
                        <p>
                                Now that you added some potential clients as connections, it is time to start 
                                <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/47538/publish-articles-on-linkedin?lang=en">
                                    publishing articles</a> to make them want to hire you.
                       <br><br>
                       LinkedIn Publisher is a way to post articles to your connections and industry. More importantly, it shows your potential clients your confidence in your target industry. Your goal should be to publish very valuable content that benefits your target prospects. If you are focused on selling your content writing services to software companies, publish an article on “How to content writers can make software articles more entertaining”. 
                       <br><br>
                       This will show potential clients that you are focused on providing value, and shows your expertise of the industry. Both of which make them likely to want to reach out to you. 
                       <br><br>
                       To create an article, first navigate to the homepage of LinkedIn and click “Write an article”. 
                    </p>          
                       <img class="blog-desc-image"  src="../images/linkedin-ss-7.png">
                       <p>
                        You will then be able to create your article. 
                       </p>
                       <img class="blog-desc-image"  src="../images/linkedin-ss-8.png">
                       <p>
                            When creating your article, be careful not to hurt your brand image by publishing a bad article. This is not something that you need to speed through. Take your time doing research on your target industry to figure out what you know that can help the people that would hire you in the future. What problems do they worry about that you could give some solutions to? What takes up their time but can be fixed by your services? What would make them make more money by using your services? 
                            <br><br>
                            These articles don’t need to always be selling your services. They actually maybe shouldn’t ever technically be selling your services. Your goal is to provide <strong>value </strong>to the industry which builds trust in you and your services.
